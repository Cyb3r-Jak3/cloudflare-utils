# Roadmap

These are things that I consider useful and would like to add:

- [ ] Flag to use `.env` file
- [ ] Add more preset lists for `sync-list` command
- [ ] Support a config file to store common flags

If you have other features in mind then feel free to request them [here](https://github.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/cloudflare-utils/issues/new)
